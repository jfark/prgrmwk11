		<h1>Jessa's Signed Books</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<p>Before MCAD, I was enrolled in a part-time fiction MFA program at Temple University for a year, and I still try to write fiction, so sometimes I go to readings and get the authors to sign books that I buy from them.</p>

		<h2>Key:</h2>
		
		<p class="embarassing">A tomato-red background indicates that I embarassed myself with the things that I stumbled over saying to the author at the time of getting my respective book signed.</p>
		<p class="oldfriend">A deep sky blue border calls out the one young author who was once a fellow peer in a writing group we belonged to in New York between 2007 and 2008.</p>
